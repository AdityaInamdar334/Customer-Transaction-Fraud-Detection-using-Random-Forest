# FraudShield-RF: Customer Transaction Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
FraudShield-RF is a **Customer Transaction Fraud Detection System** built using **Random Forest**. The model aims to detect fraudulent transactions based on various transaction features like amount, time, location, customer behavior, and card type.

This project showcases **Machine Learning (ML) techniques** to identify fraud patterns and improve detection accuracy while handling class imbalances.

## 🚀 Technologies & Concepts Used

### 🧠 **Machine Learning Algorithm**
- **Random Forest Classifier**: A powerful ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

### 📊 **Data Processing & Feature Engineering**
- **Handling Categorical Data**: Encoded categorical features like `Card_Type` into numerical values.
- **Feature Selection**: Considered key features such as transaction amount, time, location, and customer behavior.

### ⚖️ **Class Imbalance Handling**
- Fraud cases are significantly lower in number compared to non-fraud cases.
- Techniques such as **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** or **undersampling** can be used to improve model performance.

### 🔍 **Model Evaluation Metrics**
- **Accuracy Score**: Measures overall correctness of predictions.
- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### 📈 **Visualization & Analysis**
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Used to visualize the confusion matrix and feature importance.

## 🎯 Results & Findings
- The **Random Forest model achieved 94.8% accuracy**, but initially struggled with fraud detection due to class imbalance.
- Using **class balancing techniques** (e.g., oversampling), the performance on fraud detection can be improved.
- Feature importance analysis helps determine the most relevant factors in fraud detection.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
🔹 Implement **SMOTE or Undersampling** to balance fraud vs. non-fraud data.
🔹 Optimize hyperparameters to improve recall for fraud cases.
🔹 Deploy the model as an API for real-time fraud detection.
🔹 Use other ML models like **XGBoost, CatBoost, or Neural Networks** for comparison.
